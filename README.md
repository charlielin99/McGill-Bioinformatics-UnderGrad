# McGill Bioinformatics
This repository contains code for all assignments I completed voluntarily for McGill University's COMP204 (Computer Programming for Life Sciences) course worth 3 credits. 

I did so in order to gauge interest in bioinformatics, genetic engineering, and to learn industry specific knowledge to apply to future ML and algorithmic feature engineering problems related to the life sciences and healthcare.
